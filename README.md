## Welcome to Concentration Calibration! 

Here you will set out on a journey to discover potential areas of study based on what classes spark your interest.

If you have never used our website before, you should begin by registering and taking the test prompted by the blue `Take Test` button on the welcome page. The 15-question test will ask you to select the class you find most interesting from a list of four Harvard classes for each question.


On the result page, you will see a frequency breakdown by department with a pie chart. The pie chart will display the percentages of your concentration interests from the test. This'll give you some potential concentrations to mull over. We’ll also tell you the name of the department whose courses you’ve picked the most often.


Next, if you are curious or interested about a class you selected during the test, you can head to the `History` tab located atop the webpage. Here there's a pie chart similar to the one in the result page. This pie chart, however, has been updated after each test to display the breakdown of all of your past test responses. We also have a history of all of your responses, with the courses + descriptions in your 'top' concentration suggestion highlighted. If you find a course particularly interesting and want to remember it to potentially take it in future, you can STAR/UNSTAR a course, too.

Enjoy, and hopefully this helps you embark on some new and wonderful academic ventures.
